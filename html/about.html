      <div class="about-body">
        At Curry Kebab & Bar Yujin, we bring the flavors of South Asia to the
        heart of Japan. From sizzling kebabs and fluffy naan to handmade momo
        and rich, aromatic curries, our menu celebrates the food we grew up with
        — crafted with care, passion, and authenticity. <br /><br />
        Our journey started with a simple idea: to create a place where people
        can enjoy home-style Nepalese and Indian cooking in a lively, welcoming
        atmosphere. Whether you’re here for a casual lunch, a family dinner, or
        late-night drinks with friends, we want you to feel at home.
        <br /><br />
        We take pride in using fresh ingredients, bold spices, and traditional
        recipes, balanced with a modern touch that suits every taste. Pair your
        meal with our selection of beverages, and you’ll find that every visit
        has something new to enjoy. <br /><br />
        Located in Japan, our café is more than just a restaurant — it’s a
        cultural exchange, a place where East meets South Asia, and where good
        food brings people together. <br /><br />
        Come for the kebabs, stay for the momo, and leave with a smile.
